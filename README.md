# React-Proyect-Music-Shop-e-commerce
My latest proyect, after learning proficient level of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Typesrcript I advanced to a latter................ teconology. React.JS enables many features 

I kept solidifing and expanding knowledge of CSS, HTML and JS and since I had already done a previous e-commerce with similar features I got the chance to cross-compare that ecommerce with this one using react. In the former I heavily used JS to interact with the DOM while here I used JSX, there are many examples in the code where I can see the advantages of using react in comparisson to vanilla JS as well as knowing all the 'under the hood' mechanisms that are taken place behind JSX.
